## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
vehicle_length and grown_clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. Their p-values are extremely low which indicates a high level of significance.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, because the p-value is greater than zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, R squared is .7149 so the model predicts mpg correctly 71 percent of the time.
